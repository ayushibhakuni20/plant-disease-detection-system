machine learning project 
Developed plant disease detection system to assess plant health.
Designed the system to identify various plant diseases across different plant types and provide the corresponding disease names.
Trained the model using a comprehensive dataset containing multiple plant species.
Utilized the Stream lit library to create a local-hosted web application for user interaction.  
Acquired expertise in machine learning concepts and model development using convolutional neural networks.
libraries- numpy, pandas,streamlit,tenserflow,matlabplot etc.
